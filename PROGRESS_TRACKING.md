## ðŸ“‹ Detailed Implementation Log

### **Started:** December 2024

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Fix Audio Recording System**
- **Problem:** Audio streams were leaked with `std::mem::forget(stream)`, no proper stream management, threading issues
- **Solution:** 
  - Resolved `Send + Sync` threading issues with cpal::Stream on macOS CoreAudio
  - Removed direct Stream storage to avoid thread safety problems  
  - Fixed State parameter access in Tauri commands using `.inner()` method
  - Implemented proper stream lifecycle with simplified management approach
  - Increased buffer size to 5 seconds for better audio capture
  - Added proper error handling with app event emission
  - Fixed borrow checker issues with config variable usage

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Fix Settings Persistence**
- **Problem:** Settings UI worked but changes weren't saved/loaded on startup
- **Solution:** 
  - Enhanced `save_app_settings` command to integrate with all app components
  - Added settings loading on app startup with proper application to all systems
  - Updated `shortcuts.rs` to support `init_with_config` for loading saved shortcuts
  - Modified settings UI to save settings persistently on every change
  - Added proper Debug trait implementation for settings
  - Integrated settings with audio device selection, WebSocket config, and shortcuts

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Fix Global Shortcuts**
- **Problem:** Shortcuts lacked proper error handling and user feedback
- **Solution:** 
  - Added comprehensive error handling for shortcut parsing and registration
  - Implemented proper feedback with console logging and event emission
  - Added `validate_shortcut` command for real-time validation
  - Enhanced shortcut update mechanism with proper cleanup and re-registration
  - Added error event listeners in settings UI for better user experience
  - Improved error messages and debugging information

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Fix WebSocket Connection**
- **Problem:** WebSocket connection immediately closed after connecting, not Send-safe across await points
- **Solution:** 
  - Resolved MutexGuard held across await points by restructuring command functions
  - Implemented proper connection lifecycle without holding locks during async operations
  - Fixed thread safety issues in WebSocket command handlers
  - Added proper error handling and status updates for connection management
  - Simplified connection approach to avoid complex stream management for now

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Implement Audio Streaming**
- **Problem:** Audio was only captured in a buffer instead of being streamed to backend in real-time
- **Solution:** 
  - Added real-time audio chunking during recording (100ms chunks)
  - Implemented streaming audio data via "audio_chunk" events
  - Added proper buffer management to prevent memory issues
  - Fixed variable move issues in audio callbacks by cloning AppHandle
  - Integrated audio streaming with WebSocket for real-time transmission to backend
  - Added recording state checking to only process audio during active recording

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Add Connection Management**
- **Problem:** WebSocket lacked auto-reconnection and proper error handling
- **Solution:** 
  - Added auto-reconnection logic with configurable retry intervals
  - Implemented connection timeout handling (10 second timeout)
  - Added comprehensive error handling for different failure scenarios
  - Created event-based reconnection system to avoid lifetime issues
  - Added proper logging and status updates for connection events
  - Integrated reconnection events with main event loop for seamless recovery

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Fix WebSocket Message Handling (CRITICAL FIX)**
- **Problem:** WebSocket connection was immediately dropped after connecting (`drop(ws_stream)`)
- **Solution:** 
  - Removed `drop(ws_stream)` and implemented persistent connection
  - Added proper message parsing for TranscriptionResponse
  - Implemented persistent message handling with read/write task separation
  - Added proper cleanup on connection close
  - Integrated transcription response events with clipboard pasting

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Full Clipboard Integration**
- **Problem:** Enhanced text was not being pasted at cursor position
- **Solution:** 
  - Implemented AppleScript-based cursor pasting for macOS
  - Added fallback to clipboard copy for other platforms
  - Integrated with transcription response handler
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback

#### **âœ… COMPLETED: Complete End-to-End Workflow**
- **Problem:** No complete audio â†’ transcription â†’ enhancement â†’ clipboard pipeline
- **Solution:** 
  - Connected all components in proper sequence
  - Added event-driven communication between components
  - Implemented proper state management throughout workflow
  - Added comprehensive error handling at each stage
